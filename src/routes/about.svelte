				The project CastMap is be about recording live data regarding areas that are being fished around New Zealand. 
				This information is displayed graphically as stats and heat maps. This in turn engages the people fishing and supplies MPI with live data.
				The longer-term outlook for this project is that the application will be hosted on the cloud with a built-in SQL database to hold and analyse gathered and exiting data.  
				Currently, we have discovered the Ministry of Primary Industries (MPI) conducts research annually detailing the current state 
				of fish stock and adjusts quotas to suit. Some documents detail the stats that are publicly published. Realistically we can safely 
				assume that the average Joe will not read or take much notice of these documents provided by MPI.  This is a worthwhile project 
				as we can help drive sustainability for the ecosystem around the shores of New Zealand. The hope is that this application will be 
				turned into a cloud-based native application to help share and collect information that provides education for those who use it.  
				While the potential for this web application goes much further the scope will be reduced to ensure that the project workload is acceptable for the project timelines.
